  <p>
  Building a webpage has always been a great inspiration of mine. I started when I was 12 but forgot how fun it was a long the way. As code has changed over the last few years, the main markup language hasnt - which makes it fun!

  I do hope to learn a lot more and create <em>beautiful websites.</em>
